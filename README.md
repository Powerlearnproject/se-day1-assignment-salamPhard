# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.


SOLUTIONS TO ASSIGNMENT

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality and continuous functioning software systems. It involves different strategic step to achieve the end product which is the Software.
In the technology industry, Software Engineering drives innovation, ensures efficient system development, and underpins modern technology. It allows play a major role by enabling the creation of software application and systems that power various aspects of modern life.
Key Milestones in the evolution of software Engineering
1-	Development of Programming Languages: The development of old programming languages like Fortran (different versions) and C Programming languages.
2-	Establishment of Software Engineering Discipline: Another milestone is the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3-	Structured Programming: The advent of structured programming in the 1970s is another milestone in the establishment of software engineering.
PHASES OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
1.	The phases of software development life cycle includes:
a.	Requirement Phase: This is the phase where survey and all requirement are gathered as well as the system requirement
b.	Design Phase: This is the design phase where charts, diagrams and different design to begin the implementation.
c.	Implementation Phase: This is the phase where writing of codes is done and building the software according to design
d.	Testing Phase: This is the phase where the software tester, developer and the end user carry out different type of test on the software to test for bugs and workability of the software according to the user requirement.
e.	Deployment: This is when the software goes live. This phase the software and the needed documents are delivered to the end users for usage.
f.	Maintenance: This is a continuous phase where there is routine maintenance of the software.


Comparism of Waterfall and Agile and differences:
Waterfall and Agile Methodologies are both software development methodologies aimed at achieving the user requirement of the project design.
Waterfall has a sequential approach with distinct phases. The technology works like a waterfall which is why the name is given while agile is iterative and incremental approach due to flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
Waterfall is not client fully inclusive while Agile is client fully inclusive from first phase to the end phase

Roles
Software Developer: He is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: He is also the tester that uses different testing software to ensure software quality.
Project Manager: He oversees the correct planning, executing and final delivery of the project to the client

Importance of IDES and VCSs
IDEs: Integrated development Environments is the comprehensive suite that provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Used by developer and tester. Example include Visual Studio, Eclipse.
VCSs: Version Control Systems is for tracking changes to code written by more than one developer through collaboration (Git, Subversion).

Challenges Faced by Software Engineering
1.	Tight Deadlines: This is pressure to deliver software products on schedule due to issues which may arise from technical or other reasons.
2.	Changing Requirements: Users may not give full requirement at the start of the project. Hence, they change requirement as project moves which will lead to scope creep and project delays.

Strategies for Overcoming Challenges:
This include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of task e.t.c in order to achieve the best project outcome.

TYPES OF TESTING
Unit Testing: This is done by developers mostly. Unit testing is done by testing individual components or modules of software
Integration Testing: This is done by testers. The process requires testing how modules and components talk or relate which each other.
System Testing: This is testing the whole system entirely. This is also done by testers and the end users.
Acceptance Testing:  This is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs.

Importance of Quality Control:
Quality control such as code reviews, automated testing and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process.

Prompt Engineering
It’s more like the fun way of talking to Artificial Intelligent. It’s a way of giving instruction to robot to do something and waiting for response from the robot. It involves saying the exact request needed so that one can get the required answer from the AI.
Importance of Prompt Engineering
It allows the AI to do exactly what is needed. The more you know how to talk to it, the easier it is to give the best response. Its just like learning a new language, you will be able to give clear instructions to your AI assistant.
Example
Vague Prompt:  Tell me days in Arab.
Correct Prompt: Tell me the days of the week in Arabic language.

For prompt to be more effective it must be
1.	Be clear: Instructions are easy to understand
2.	Be Specific: more detailed
3.	Be curious: Experimenting with different prompts to see how AI responds
